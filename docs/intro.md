# Introduction

Antitoken is pioneering a quantum-inspired approach to decentralized finance through its entangled token pair system, featuring `$ANTI` and `$PRO` tokens. This innovative framework leverages principles from quantum mechanics to create interconnected token dynamics, where the behavior of one token directly influences the other.

Central to this system is the Collider contract, which facilitates reversible transformations between `$ANTI` and `$PRO`, ensuring seamless transitions while preserving systemic integrity.
